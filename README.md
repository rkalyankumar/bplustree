A simple in-memory B+Tree data structure implemented in C++.
Current version: 0.1
As of version 0.1 following are implemented:
  1) Insert key/value entries
  2) Find key/value entries
  3) Print entire tree to console

Remove key/value entries implementation is underway.

Once remove entries implementation is complete, I will try to provide persistent disk store
version of B+Tree based on my time!

You are free to use the code as per Apache2.0 license. Please read the accompanied LICENSE file fore more details.

If you are wondering there is no C++ header file, that's right - there is no header file. Everything goes into one single C++ file (bplustree.cpp) so as to keep all the code intact & make things so simple.
